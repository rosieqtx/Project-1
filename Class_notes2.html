    <body><h1>Lesson 1</h1>
	<h2>What's a web page?</h2>

		<p>A web page is a text document. The language used is primarily HTML. </p>
<h2>How Coding Works</h2>

	<div>Coding is talking to the computer in a language the computer understands. It needs to be exactly right because computers are stupid. </div>
	



<h2>Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>

<ul><li>Tag: An HTML tag is what the computer takes direction from. Most tags have an opening tag. Some tags are called "void" tags and do not require a closing tag.</li>

<li>Element: An HTML element is everything within opening and closing tags.</li>

<li> Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element, put inside a tag.</li></ul>

<h1>Lesson 2</h1>
<p>Everything is a tree.</p>
<p>DOM stands for Document Object Model</p>
<p>How to break a design into boxes - because everything on the web is a box</p>

<h2>Box Sizing</h2>

<p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components. These are the box, padding, border, and margin.</p>

<p>It is hard to size boxes acurately. </p>

  <ul><li>Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.</li>
   <li>   Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</li></ul> 

<h2>Box Positioning (Notes directly taken from class slide.)</h2>

   <div class="demo"><div class="bitty"> Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</div>
   <div class="bitty"> Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</div></div>
    
    <h2>Structure</h2>
<p>HTML and CSS follow a logical structure, where each element has attributes and each subelement either has its own attributes or inherits the attributes of the element above it. This can be diagrammed in a tree shape.</p>
<p><h2>Avoiding repetition</h2>
<p>One key element of programming is avoiding repetition. In this document, one way I avoided repetition by using CSS to style the H2 tag rather than using the b tag and styling it everytime I wanted a subheading. CSS classes are another great way to avoid repetition.</p></body>
